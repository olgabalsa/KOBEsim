# KOBEsim-code
Bayesian algorithm to increase the observational strategy efficiency in RV surveys. Given a hypothesis of a planet orbiting at a particular period, the algorithm finds the **optimum next observing date** considering the survey's schedule. KOBEsim uses a weighted Bayes factor as metric to find a trade-off between the number of observations and the timespan required to detect the hypothetical planet (O. Balsalobre-Ruza et al., submitted).
