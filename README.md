# KOBEsim-code
Bayesian algortithm to improve the observational strategy in RV surveys (O. Balsalobre-Ruza et al., submitted).

Given an hypothesys of a planet orbiting at a period P, the algorithm delivers a list of candidate next observing dates ordered by priority (with the possibility of giving a schedule file as input). Thus, KOBEsim finds the next optimum date to observe the target finding a trade-off between number of observations and timespan required to detect the hypothetical planet.
