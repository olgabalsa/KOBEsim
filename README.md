# KOBEsim-code

Bayesian algortithm to increase the observational strategy efficiency in RV surveys. Given a hypothesis of a planet orbiting at a period P, the algorithm finds the optimum next observing date taking into account the syrvey's schedule. KOBEsim uses a weighted Bayes factor as metric to find a trade-off between the number of observations and the timespan required to detect the hypothetical planet (O. Balsalobre-Ruza et al., submitted).
