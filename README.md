Given an hypothesys of a planet orbiting at a period P, the algorithm delivers a list of candidate next observing dates ordered by priority (with the possibility of giving a schedule file as input). KOBEsim uses the Bayes factor as a metric to find the next optimum observing date reaching a trade-off between number of observations and timespan required to detect the hypothetical planet.
